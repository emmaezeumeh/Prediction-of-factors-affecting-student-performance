The data were obtained in a survey of students math and portuguese language courses in secondary school. 
It contains a lot of interesting social, gender and study information about students. 

## Task

My objective is to find the predictors in this dataset that most strongly affects students performance. 
I preproccessed the data, conducted exploratory data analysis on the dataset and then found the correlation between the features and between the features and the outcome (student performance).


## Result
My results indicate that either of the student's parents being educated, with the mother's education being more strongly correlated,  and the student's interest in pursuing a higher education have the strongest positive correlation with a student's performance. Past failures has the strongest negative correlation with the student's performance.
Also, alcohol consumption, whether on weekdays or weekends, has the strongest positive correlation with absences from school and longer traveltimes. Alcohol consumption has the strongest negative correlation with how long the student spends studying.
